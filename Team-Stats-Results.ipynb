    "### Methods ###\n",
    "##### Data Acquisition #####\n",
    "We gathered NBA statistical data from a variety of sources. Data for our team analysis came from **stats.nba.com, and basketball-reference.com.** Acquiring the data proved to be a challenging and time consuming task, but we anticipated this. For two of our data sources (kaggle and NBA.com), acquiring the data was trivial. For basketball reference, we had to build a lengthy scraper. In the end, we succesffuly gathered **20 seasons worth of NBA team data**.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Data Cleaning #####\n",
    "We did not anticipate the need to clean our dataset, but encountered several nuances that required adjustments. For the team dataset, we **updated all franchise name/location changes to their 2021 conventions**. We also added several categorical columns to reflect playoff performance based on publicly available records.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Analysis #####\n",
    "We combined **classification** and **regression** analyses to make predictions about the 2021 Utah Jazz's playoff performance. Our regression analyses helped us to find key traits of championship teams. We used correaltion matrices and heat maps to try and narrow down the statistics that are most related to championships. With that understanding, we trained several **SVM models** to predict playoff results based on standard NBA statistics. Some models had a high level of accuracy, while others proved to be quite flawed. "

    "##### What are the key qualities of NBA Champions? #####\n",
    "Looking at the top row of the heat map below, it is clear that **none of the statistics have a very strong positive or negative correlation with winning championships**. At best, we can reach only trivial conclusions: winning games has a positive correlation with winning championships as does making a finals appearance. Although, neither of these conclusions are special, one meaningful insight we can make is that **Blocks Allowed** exhibits the largest negative corelation with winning championships.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding in another wrinkle, **the correlations between any statistics across the board tend to decrease, the farther into the playoffs you go**. For example, consider +/-. This stat has a very strong correlation with winning and making it to the first round of the playoffs (based on the color, I would guess a correlation near 1). But as you consider the correlation between the second round of the playoffs and +/-, the value drops significantly. The pattern continues all the way up to the finals where the correlation between +/- and winning a championship is around 0.25. \n",
    "\n",
    "This could possibly be explained by a lack of data on finals/championship teams. In the past 20 years, only 20 teams have won a championship. Or perhaps, this suggests that stats alone have a hard time predicting championships. Chemistry, previous champion winners, mental toughness or a variety of other factors could have difficult-to-quantify influences on winning championships. Applying this to our results, we can say that our **uncertainty grows considerably as we try to make predictions about deep playoff runs**. In the case of the Utah Jazz, we feel more confident in the results suggesting the outcomes of the first two rounds of the playoffs than the results about the finals.\n",

    "##### How do the Jazz's stats compare to the median stats of NBA Champions? ######\n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless of correlations and the heat map, we can get an overall idea of the caliber of the Utah Jazz by comparing their season stats so far with the median values of championship winners over the past 20 years. The table below shows the median stats for all teams over the last 20 years and median stats for champions from the last 20 years. **Any stat where the Jazz outperform the champs's corresponding median stat is highlighted green**.\n",
    "As can be visually seen, the jazz performance so far, is better than the median stats of champions in almost every statsitcal category. Notably, the Jazz are outperforming the median champs's stats in PTS, 3PM, 3P%, REB, and +/- **by considerable margins**.\n",
